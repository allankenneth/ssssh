# Ssssh!
The city of Victoria, British Columbia has noise bylaws. This site is based upon on a reading of the bylaws and a custom data representation was derived from that. The page simply takes the current date and time and shows you what types of noise you are or are not allowed to make.

Ssssh! is not affiliated with the City of Victoria, British Columbia in any way and is not guaranteed to be accurate.

Ssssh! was created in the spirit that more people would follow the bylaws and be respectful of their neighbors if they had an easy way to check the bylaws that didn't involve reading a 20 page PDF to find the relevant section relative to the current date and time.
